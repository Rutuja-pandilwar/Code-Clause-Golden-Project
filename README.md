Blindness Detection
 
 #Introduction
- This repository presents a solution to the Diabetic Retinopathy Detection task using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm.
- Objective: Create an automated system to predict the severity of Diabetic Retinopathy in retina images.

#Dataset Description
The dataset contains high-resolution retina images captured under various imaging conditions using different cameras and models.
Each image is labeled with a severity score on a scale of 0 to 4, representing different stages of Diabetic Retinopathy.
Severity Categories:
"NO DR" - Severity 0
"MILD" - Severity 1
"MODERATE" - Severity 2
"SEVERE" - Severity 3
"PROLIFERATIVE" - Severity 4
🚀 Approach to Blindness Detection

Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 🧠🖥️
CNNs are powerful for image classification tasks, as they automatically learn features from images.
Platform: Google Colab 💻
Google Colab provides free access to GPU resources, speeding up model development.
Dataset: Kaggle 📊
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle's Diabetic Retinopathy Detection competition, offering diverse retina images.
